# ðŸš€ Rocketseat Explorer - D5 - Challenge: Simple JS Calculator

- This challenge was part of Rocketseat's Explorer program and made me create a simple JS Calculator that shows sum, subtraction, multiplication, division and the rest of division. It also shows if the two numbers entered are equal and if the final sum is even or odd.
